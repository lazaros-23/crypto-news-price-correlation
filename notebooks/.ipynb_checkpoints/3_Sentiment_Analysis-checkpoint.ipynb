    "**`VADER` (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It is fully open-sourced under the [MIT License] (we sincerely appreciate all attributions and readily accept most contributions, but please don't hold us liable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`compound score`** is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between **-1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive)**. This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful for researchers who would like to **set standardized thresholds** for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative. Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **positive sentiment**: `compound score >= 0.05`\n",
    "* **neutral sentiment**: `(compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)`\n",
    "* **negative sentiment**: `compound score <= -0.05`\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The compound score is the one most commonly used for sentiment analysis by most researchers, including the authors."
